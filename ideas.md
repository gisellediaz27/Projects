Food Shelf Life Prediction:

Addressing food waste is a critical concern, and 
predicting shelf life has practical applications 
in supply chain management

Dynamic Pricing for Perishable Goods:

Create a pricing model that dynamically adjusts 
prices for perishable food items based on factors 
such as demand, shelf life, and inventory levels

Batch Quality Prediction in Food Manufacturing:

Predict the quality of food product batches during 
the manufacturing process, aiding in early detection 
and prevention of defects

Predictive Maintenance for Food Processing Equipment:

Develop a model to predict when maintenance is required 
for food processing machinery to minimize downtime and 
disruptions in the supply chain.
